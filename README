BiG World Setup-ReLOADED

This will be the readme for the BiG World Setup revival. Right now, it's empty.

I will have a seperate file for what I'm planning to implement, and will
mark off ideas that I have done so far, or someone else did.

It's an idea, but it's one worth pursuing.

The setup uses Apache's Xerces 2 for Java for it's XML parsing libary. That is licensed under the Apache License 2.0 -
the setup itself uses the GNU GPL 3.0.

The JUNIT testing library is also used, which is licensed under the Common Public License 1.0
