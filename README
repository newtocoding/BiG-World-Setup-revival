BiG World Setup-ReLOADED

This will be the readme for the BiG World Setup revival. Right now, it's empty.

I will have a seperate file for what I'm planning to implement, and will
mark off ideas that I have done so far, or someone else did.

It's an idea, but it's one worth pursuing.

The setup is licensed with the GNU GPLv3, as I believe in free software and the right to modify. This program uses
the Xerces XML parser, which is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.
